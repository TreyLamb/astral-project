        <h2>What is Astral Projection?</h2>
        <p className="intro">
          Astral projection, also known as an out-of-body experience (OBE), is the practice of consciously
          separating your consciousness from your physical body to explore non-physical planes of existence.
          Practitioners report traveling through space, visiting distant locations, and experiencing realms
          beyond ordinary perception.

            <h3>Relaxation</h3>
            <p>
              Lie down in a comfortable position. Progressively relax each muscle group from
              your toes to your head. Release all physical tension and let your body become
              completely still.
            </p>

            <h3>Enter Hypnagogic State</h3>
            <p>
              Maintain awareness as your body falls asleep. You'll enter the state between
              waking and sleeping. Stay conscious while your body becomes paralyzed - this
              is normal and safe.

            <h3>Deepen Your State</h3>
            <p>
              Focus on the darkness behind your closed eyes. You may see colors, patterns,
              or lights. Let these visions come without attachment. Deepen your relaxation
              and awareness.

            <h3>Vibration Stage</h3>
            <p>
              Many experience vibrations or electrical sensations throughout the body.
              Don't be alarmed - this is a sign you're ready to separate. Remain calm
              and let the vibrations intensify.

            <h3>Separation</h3>
            <p>
              Use a technique to separate: visualize floating upward, rolling out of your
              body, or standing up. Maintain strong intention and confidence. Don't use
              physical force - it's all mental.

            <h3>Explore & Return</h3>
            <p>
              Once separated, explore your surroundings. Move by intention rather than
              physical effort. To return, simply think of your body or intend to return.
              You'll snap back instantly.

        <div className="technique">
          <h3>The Rope Technique</h3>
          <p>
            Visualize a rope hanging above you. Without moving your physical body, imagine
            reaching up and climbing the rope hand over hand. Feel the texture and pull yourself
            upward until you separate from your body.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="technique">
          <h3>The Roll-Out Method</h3>
          <p>
            Once deeply relaxed, imagine rolling to your side like you're getting out of bed.
            Don't move physically - only visualize the motion. Your astral body should roll out
            while your physical body remains still.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="technique">
          <h3>Wake Back to Bed (WBTB)</h3>
          <p>
            Set an alarm for 4-6 hours after falling asleep. Wake up, stay awake for 20-30 minutes,
            then return to bed with the intention to astral project. Your mind will be alert while
            your body quickly falls back to sleep.
